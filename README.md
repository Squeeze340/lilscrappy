## Note

Found issue where the chrome dirver was outdated. Updated the local chromedriver version to 112 matching the chrome version of 112. Needed to add the new chrome driver binary to the `usr/local/bin` directory. Download link <https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=112.0.5615.28/>
